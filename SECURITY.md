We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in drizzle-cubrid, please report it responsibly by emailing:

### Response Timeline

## What Qualifies as a Security Issue

A security issue is any vulnerability that could:

- Allow unauthorized access to data
- Permit SQL injection or other code execution attacks
- Expose sensitive information (credentials, tokens, private data)
- Compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system

Examples include:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in query construction
- ORM-level data leaks or access control bypasses
- Insecure credential handling
- Type system bypasses leading to unsafe queries

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using drizzle-cubrid, follow these security best practices:

- Always use Drizzle's typed query builder to prevent SQL injection
- Keep drizzle-cubrid and drizzle-orm updated to the latest versions
- Use secure connection parameters when connecting to CUBRID databases
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database credentials
- Never hardcode credentials in your application code
- Use environment variables or secure credential management systems

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. A security patch will be released
2. The vulnerability will be disclosed in release notes
3. Credit will be given to the reporter (if requested)

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and help in keeping drizzle-cubrid secure.
