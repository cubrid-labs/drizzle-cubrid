## Code Style

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.

### Rules

- **Indent**: Tabs
- **Line width**: 100 characters
- **Quote style**: Double quotes
- **Semicolons**: Always

### Running Checks

```bash
# Check lint and format
npx biome check src/ tests/

# Auto-fix
npx biome check --write src/ tests/
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature main
   ```

2. **Write tests** for any new functionality.

3. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run typecheck
   ```

4. **Run lint checks**:
   ```bash
   npx biome check src/ tests/
   ```

### PR Content

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Write a clear title and description explaining _what_ and _why_.
- Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
- Update documentation if your change affects the public API.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of your change.

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one review before merge.
- CI must pass (lint, type check, tests).
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly approved.
